### 📜 Problem Description

Given an  `n x n`  array of integers  `matrix` , return  *the  **minimum sum**  of any  **falling path**  through*   `matrix` .

A  **falling path**  starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position  `(row, col)`  will be  `(row + 1, col - 1)` ,  `(row + 1, col)` , or  `(row + 1, col + 1)` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[2,1,3],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
Explanation: There are two falling paths with a minimum sum as shown.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[-19,57],[-40,-5]]
Output: -59
Explanation: The falling path with a minimum sum is shown.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
	
- `1 <= n <= 100`
	
- `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`
